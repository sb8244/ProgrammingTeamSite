    <h1>All about Competitions <small>Trust us, they're fun</small></h1>
    <p>Competitions are times where practiced teams can get together with other teams from
      other regions to see who can solve the most problems in the fastest amount of time. The
      competitions usually last up to 5 hours and feature a wide variety of problem types. 
      Almost all competitions give out awesome prizes and free swag. Plus, they look amazing
      on your resume.</p>
    <h3>What are the competitions?</h3>

    <div class='well'>
      <h3>In the Fall</h3>

      <h4>In-House Competitions</h4>
      <p class='indent'>
        These are competitions open only to Shippensburg students. The problems are made by either professors
        or a Programming Team Cabinet Member. Pizza is given out as well as cash prizes. We shoot for 2-3 per year.
        These are held in the Spring as well and all CS students should participate.
      </p>

      <h4><a target='_blank' href='http://midatl.radford.edu/'>ACM Regionals</a></h4>
      <p class='indent'>Schools from around the area come to compete at Shippensburg! Our entire
        floor plan gets switched around to accomodate everyone. Check-in starts around 8:30am. We
        have free breakfast, a practice run, and then lunch. Following that, the real fun begins!
        Afterwards, pizza is consumed and we find out the score results. Winners from the region get
        to go straight to World's!

          IEEExtreme 24 Hour
        </a>
      </h4>
      <p class='indent'>
        This competition is for extreme programmers! It lasts for 24 hours and has typically featured over
        2000 teams from all around the world. The problems are released in waves so that you have to be
        active for the entire time in order to do well. This is extremely tiring but EXTREMELY fun!

      <p class='indent'>
        This is a super casual competition which acts as a warm up for ACM. Pizza is provided and the problem
        set is designed to be easier than other competitions. <strong>This is recommended for anyone and everyone!</strong>

      <h3>In the Spring</h3>
      <h4>Dickinson</h4>
      <p class='indent'>
        Hosted at the nearby Dickinson University, this is a shorter competition which features local universities.

      <h4><a target='_blank' href='http://www.pacise.org/'>PACISE Conference</a></h4>
      <p class='indent'>
        This is hosted at one of the 14 state schools and only features state schools in the competition. It also
        features a conference alongside which some faculty and students present at. There is always a keynote
        speaker and banquet, and lodging depending on how far it is hosted from us.

      <h3>Sometimes...</h3>
      <h4><a target='_blank' href='http://csgames.org/'>CS Games (Canada)</a></h4>
      <p class='indent'>
        Canada...that's right. This is a competition held in a different school in Canada each Spring. The competitions
        feature all areas of Computer Science (not just Programming Team). We have gone in the past but fundraising and
        distance have a large impact. Who knows, maybe we'll go this year!
